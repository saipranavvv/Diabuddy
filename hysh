Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Component: Data Collection and Preprocessing module.
Function: Collects financial data from reliable sources, such as stock prices, financial indicators, and market data.
Responsibilities:
Data gathering from various sources.
Data cleaning, normalization, and transformation to ensure consistency and quality.
Feature engineering, if necessary, to extract relevant information for further analysis.
Stock Clustering Module:

Component: Stock Clustering module.
Function: Categorizes stocks into risk categories (high, medium, low) based on selected features.
Responsibilities:
Utilizes ML algorithms (such as k-means clustering) to group stocks based on their risk characteristics.
Considers factors like historical price volatility, financial indicators, and market data to determine risk levels.
Outputs the categorized stock clusters for further analysis.
Time Series Analysis Module:

Component: Time Series Analysis module.
Function: Performs time series analysis to forecast future behavior of individual stocks.
Responsibilities:
Applies ML-based time series forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) to predict future stock prices or returns.
Considers historical patterns, market trends, and other relevant factors to generate time series predictions.
Produces forecasts for each stock within the categorized clusters.
Expert System:

Component: Expert System.
Function: Provides domain expertise, rules, and guidance throughout the analysis and decision-making process.
Responsibilities:
Incorporates a knowledge base containing expert-derived rules, facts, and heuristics related to financial markets, risk assessment, and investment strategies.
Takes inputs from the Stock Clustering module, Time Series Analysis module, and user-specific information.
Applies rule-based reasoning and logical inference to provide guidance and recommendations for portfolio optimization.
Enhances decision-making by incorporating expert knowledge and ensuring compliance with regulations and ethical standards.
Portfolio Optimization Module:

Component: Portfolio Optimization module.
Function: Optimizes the portfolio allocation based on risk profiles, return expectations, and expert recommendations.
Responsibilities:
Utilizes portfolio optimization techniques (e.g., MVO, Black-Litterman) and ML-driven optimization algorithms.
Takes inputs from the Expert System, Stock Clustering module, Time Series Analysis module, and user-specific data (e.g., existing portfolio, transactions, risk tolerance).
Generates optimal portfolio allocations that consider risk diversification, return objectives, and constraints.
Outputs the recommended portfolio allocations for the user.
Report Generation:

Component: Report Generation module.
Function: Generates a comprehensive report summarizing the analysis, recommendations, and insights for the customer.
Responsibilities:
Takes inputs from the Expert System, Stock Clustering module, Time Series Analysis module, and Portfolio Optimization module.
Integrates the outputs to create a report with categorized stocks, time series predictions, recommended portfolio allocations, and explanations based on both ML-driven analysis and expert-derived insights.
Includes visualizations, summaries, and relevant information to provide a clear understanding for the customer.
Delivers the generated report to the customer.
